# Session Flow

[vertical-sep]

##Â Overview

* We are going to divide ourselves into small groups
    * Creating a chain with those groups 1-2-3...etc.

* The session duration will be divided into multiple iterations (3?).

## First iteration (20 min)

* It will be longer and each group will have an icebreaker challenge on their table.

* **The icebreaker is not meant to be the focus of the discussion during the first iteration**, but just to serve as a firestarter

* The group will brainstorm to find challenges and/or solutions/tools to discuss and share

## Subsequent iterations (10 min)

* A member of the team reads the new arrived challenges out loud
    * Try to solve those
    * Get inspired and add new challenges or solutions

# Wrapup phase

[vertical-sep]

## 10 final minutes to wrapup

* Depending on how the session went we might:
    * -C/+S: Go through some of the solutions/tools if someone wants to volunteer
    * +C/-S: Discuss some recurrent challenges
    * -C/-S: A demo of a tool that we think might be interesting
