## Duration

* We have only one hour so do not stress out... we do not plan to save the world today!!

* There will be a [repo](https://github.com/jjelosua/botillo) that aggregates what we have achieved and allows us to continue contributing to the community.

* It's just a beginning, trying to profit from the unusual fact that many of our community has gathered here.
